### This is a alpha aplication in early development. There are many bugs, missing features, and (very few) crashes.

# Clarity
A desktop internet music player.
Play, Download, and Organize your music.

## Release Date
Soon™.

## Platforms
I'm targeting all desktop platforms (Linux, MacOS, Windows), although Windows will be available at the beta launch.

Note: Unzip assets/libs.7z to the same location (src/app/assets/libs/) during development to enable MPV backend.
This is not required for release, installer handles it for you.
