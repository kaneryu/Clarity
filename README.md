# InnerTuneDesktop
A desktop music player compliant with InnerTune mobile backups.
The desktop application will allow loading of mobile backups, which means you can keep your liked songs, downloaded songs, custom lyrics and song names, and everything else.
It will also come with a few new features, like a smarter reccomendation engine, while still keeping the exported backups backwards compatible.
In the future, there may be an ability for your mobile Inntertune to sync with InnerTuneDestkop, leading to a more cohesive experience, but that's still in the works.

## Release Date
Soon™.

## Platforms
I'm targeting all desktop platforms (Linux, MacOS, Windows), although most likely only Windows will be available at the beta launch.
